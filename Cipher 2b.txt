THE REBELLION, LED BY QUEEN BOUDICCA, TOOK STRENGTH FROM THE DEFEAT OF THE NINTH LEGION. THE ICENI WERE JOINED BY THE TRINOVANTES TRIBE AS THEY SET UPON BOTH LONDINIUM AND VERULAMIUM. THEY RAZED THE CITIES TO THE GROUND AND DESECRATED OUR TEMPLES. SUETONIUS, INFORMED BY VARUS LEGATUS OF THE IX LEGION OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION, RETURNED FROM SUBDUING REBELS ON THE ISLAND OF MONAAND, CONFRONTED THE ENEMY AT VIROCONIUM AS HE TRAVELLED BACK ALONG WATLING STREET. IN HIS OWN WORDS, DESPITE BEING OUTNUMBERED TEN TO ONE, THE BRAVERY AND HEROISM OF OUR FORCES, AND MY CAREFUL CHOICE OF THE BATTLEGROUND AND TACTICS, ENSURED OUR DECISIVE AND GLORIOUS VICTORY. WHOEVER MASTERMINDED THE BATTLE, THE ENEMY LOST MANY THOUSANDS AGAINST JUST A FEW HUNDRED OF OUR OWN TROOPS AND AGRICOLA WAS LEFT TO SECURE THE REGION, ACTING WITH RUTHLESS EFFICIENCY - PERHAPS IN PART TO ATONE FOR HIS GUILT OVER THE PREVIOUS LOSS HE SUPPRESSED THE REBELLION. BOUDICCA, POSSESSED OF THE PERILOUSNESS OF HER SITUATION, TOOK HER OWN LIFE, CURSING THE IXTH LEGION AS SHE DIED, BUT A BATTLE IS NOT A WAR AND THE TRUE PERIL WAS ABOUT TO BE REVEALED. A CAPTURED ENEMY SPY REVEALED THAT THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO DECIPHER CAPTURED BATTLE ORDERS AND COMMUNICATIONS, WHICH HAD BEEN ENCRYPTED USING THE CAESAR CIPHER. THIS DEVICE, INVENTED BY JULIUS CAESAR HIMSELF, HAD SECURED MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC COMMUNICATIONS ACROSS THE EMPIRE FOR DECADES. IT WAS NO LONGER SAFE AND NEITHER WERE WE, SUETONIUS'S DESPATCHES TO THE EMPEROR WERE CAREFUL TO GIVE HIMSELF THE CREDIT FOR THE DEFEAT OF BOUDICCA, AND LEFT NO DOUBT THAT AGRICOLA WAS TO BLAME FOR THE UPRISING. THE LOSS OF THE LEGIONS AQUILA WAS SAID TO HAVE ENCOURAGED THE LOCAL TRIBES TO REBEL, AND IT WAS HINTED THAT AGRICOLA MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN TO BLAME FOR THE LOSS OF THE CAESAR CIPHER. WHAT SUETONIUS FAILED TO REVEAL WAS THAT IT WAS AGRICOLA WHO ENGINEERED THE DEFEAT OF THE TRIBES ON WATLING STREET. BUT IF YOU WISH TO KNOW THE TRUTH OF THAT DAY, THEN YOU WILL NEED TO TRAVEL FURTHER, TO THE ISLE OF THORNS.
